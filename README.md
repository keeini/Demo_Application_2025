# Demo_Application_2025
This demo application will utilize scatter, bar, and line charts from multiple activities all in one!
<!-- STRONG --> 
- __SOAR_NFB_2024 (Scatter)__: Property vs Distance and Income vs Work hours
- __CSUN_2024_DEMO (Bar)__: Allergies and Art Scores
- __LDV_User_Study_2024 (Line)__: S9 Line

This will be a guide to easily navigate the app.

## SOAR Scatter Charts
- __Vibrations:__ The scatter charts will have a constant vibration when 1 finger is on a colored section of any point on the graph. If you put your finger on the grey outline around the colored point, the frequency of the vibration is going to change. 
- __TTS:__ You can also move your finger to any of the text which will enable tts to read out the titled text. The app will state if you are in the chart through tts, and by holding your finger down on any section INSIDE of the graph, it will read out the x and y values to you.
- __Mode:__ By swiping to the left using 4 fingers, you can change the chart "mode". You will know if the chart mode changes as the tts will say "mode change". On start up, the chart has a bell noise that increases in pitch with the increasing x-value points, but with the mode change, there will be a more subtle noise that uses spatial audio.

## CSUN Bar Charts
